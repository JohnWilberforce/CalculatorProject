# CalculatorProject
This is a small objected oriented programming project on a calculator
Objected oriented programming helps create an instance of a real world object
It helps in creating a neat and reusable program
 A class is a collection of objects
it starts by calling a class of the instance(object) you want to create, in the case we create a class called calculator
A class represents a group of objects with the same characteristics
so inside the class you would want to classify the attributes or properties of objects in the class(which is represented by variables) and behaviour(which is represented by methods of functions) 
From this class created objects within the class can be created
